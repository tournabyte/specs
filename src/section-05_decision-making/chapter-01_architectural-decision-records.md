# Architectural decision records

Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) are short, lightweight documents that capture important architecture or design decisions, including the context, options, rationale, and consequences. They are stored alongside the code and evolve as the system evolves.

## Benefits of ADRs

- Transparency and understanding
- Support for evolutionary architecture
- Better decision making
- Lightweight documentation
- Risk reduction and compliance

## ADRs typically include

- Context – why the decision is needed
- Decision – what was chosen
- Options & Rationale – what was considered and why
- Consequences – impact, trade-offs, risks
- Changelog – evolution over time
