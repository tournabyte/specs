# Sprint Retrospective - 6 (2025-12-06)

## What went well?
<!-- Bullets on anything that went well during this sprint -->
- Code maintainability is on a great trajectory given how easy to implement changes were this sprint
- Flexibility of NoSQL data store shined when document structure needed updating

## What didn't go well?
<!-- Bullets on anything that did not go exactly as planned this sprint -->
- Poor choice of wording to target a fully featured database abstraction when an ergonomic adapter was the goal

## What could go better?
<!-- Bullets on anything that could be improved for future sprints -->
- Integration of the adapter did not happen with any database access logic (more of a stretch goal)

## Follow-up from Last Retrospective
<!-- Check status of action items from previous ceremonies -->
<!-- Check status of adjustments made from last sprint -->
- Log automation has made no progress
- More use of interfaces was present in this sprint's work product
- Tests are not included in story cards, but are still done in practice
