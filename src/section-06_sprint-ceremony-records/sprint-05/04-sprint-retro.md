# Sprint Retrospective - ($SPRINT_NUMBER) ($DATE)

## What went well?
<!-- Bullets on anything that went well during this sprint -->
- Focus on missed stories from last print enabled their completion this time around
- Instead of constraining to simple stdlib testing, reached out to use tooling that conforms to familiar understanding

## What didn't go well?
<!-- Bullets on anything that did not go exactly as planned this sprint -->
- Database abstractions are tied with service code which is not ideal for expansion to multiple services in the future
- Testability of code is questionable with exclusive use of concrete types and no interfaces

## What could go better?
<!-- Bullets on anything that could be improved for future sprints -->
- Learn to utilize the interfaces of Go's type system for testability and flexibility
- Separate testing from implementation stories

## Follow-up from Last Retrospective
<!-- Check status of action items from previous ceremonies -->
<!-- Check status of adjustments made from last sprint -->
- Log automation has made no progress
- Task volume was much more manageable for this sprint compared to last
