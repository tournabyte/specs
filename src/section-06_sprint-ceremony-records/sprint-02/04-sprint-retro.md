# Sprint Retrospective - 2 (2025-10-10)

## What went well?
<!-- Bullets on anything that went well during this sprint -->
- Executing the decision record allowed for exploratory research to assist in making a solid decision
- Sprint ceremony recording helped with time limits for ceremonies and meeting agendas

## What didn't go well?
<!-- Bullets on anything that did not go exactly as planned this sprint -->
- Early exploratory of unique data management solution (graphdb) wasted time for deeper research into more appropriate solutions
- Decision to used self-hosted data management solution was challenged during review, but monetary costs supersede operational costs

## What could go better?
<!-- Bullets on anything that could be improved for future sprints -->
- Task definition should not entertain solutions that are obviously inappropriate
- Task estimation should be less evenly distributed, with more emphasis on tasks that will actually take more time
- Setting up meeting logs can be automated with a shell script to save time

## Follow-up from Last Retrospective
<!-- Check status of action items from previous ceremonies -->
<!-- Check status of adjustments made from last sprint -->
