<!-- Agreements about readiness, phrasing, acceptance criteria, or decomposition of backlog items discussed -->
<!-- Each item discussed in the meeting should have its dedicated subsection here -->

### User account persistence

#### Scenario

**Updated from:**

- Unspecified

**To:**

- As a service provider, I want to persist user account records in MongoDB so that user data can be stored and retrieved reliably across sessions and service restarts.

#### Acceptance criteria

**Updated from:**

- Unspecified

**To:**

- [ ] The service can create and persist a user account record with an `_id` field corresponding to MongoDB's autogenerated document ID
- [ ] The service can retrieve a user account by its `_id` field
- [ ] Account records persist between service restarts
- [ ] Persistence operations may attempt up to 3 retries before returning an unsuccessful persistence error response
- [ ] Duplicate `_id` fields are disallowed (This is inherently provided by the autogenerated document ID)
- [ ] Tests can confirm persist, retrieve and retry behavior

#### Status

**Updated from:**

- Unspecified

**To:**

- Ready

### Account service over HTTP

#### Scenario

**Updated from:**

- Unspecified

**To:**

- As a service consumer, I want to interact with the account service through RESTful HTTP endpoints, so that I can create and retrieve user account records stored in MongoDB.

#### Acceptance criteria

**Updated from:**

- Unspecified

**To:**

- [ ] Create Account Endpoint (POST /accounts) 
    - [ ] Accepts JSON payload representing a user account. 
    - [ ] Persists the record in MongoDB. 
    - [ ] Returns 201 Created with the created resource (including \_id) on success. 
    - [ ] Returns 4XX for invalid input or duplicate record attempts. 
    - [ ] Returns 5XX if persistence fails after retries. 
- [ ] Retrieve Account Endpoint (GET /accounts/{id}) 
    - [ ] Returns the corresponding account record in JSON format if found. 
    - [ ] Returns 404 Not Found if the record does not exist. 
    - [ ] Returns 5XX for server or database errors. 
- [ ] The service must follow standard REST conventions and HTTP status codes. 
- [ ] Endpoints are open (unauthenticated) for now; authentication will be added in future stories. 
- [ ] Tests confirm correct responses, status codes, and data persistence.

#### Status

**Updated from:**

- Unspecified

**To:**

- Ready
