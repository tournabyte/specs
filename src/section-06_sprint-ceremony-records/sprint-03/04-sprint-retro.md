# Sprint Retrospective - 3 (2025-10-24)

## What went well?
<!-- Bullets on anything that went well during this sprint -->
- Tasks were well defined and working through them was self-explanatory
- Ceremony structure stabilized due to templated meeting notes

## What didn't go well?
<!-- Bullets on anything that did not go exactly as planned this sprint -->
- Unforeseen deprecation of tool installer was worrisome, but native solution could easily replace
- Task estimates were still too evenly distributed when some tasks ended up taking the majority of the story points assigned

## What could go better?
<!-- Bullets on anything that could be improved for future sprints -->
- Assign more story points more appropriately based on task's complexity rather than trying to evenly distribute them

## Follow-up from Last Retrospective
<!-- Check status of action items from previous ceremonies -->
<!-- Check status of adjustments made from last sprint -->
- Task estimation is still too evenly distributed, especially for some trivial (but necessary) tasks
- Meeting log automation has not made any progress
- More detailed tasks did not allow for the exploration of irrelevant solutions
