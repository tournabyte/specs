  - Product managers and stakeholders reviewing decisions  
  - DevOps engineers setting up and maintaining infrastructure

## Organization

The documentation is organized into clear sections:

### [01-overview]()

- **Project Vision**: Why this project exists, target users, business goals  
- **System Architecture Overview**: High-level diagrams of services and data flow  
- **Glossary**: Definitions of key terms, acronyms, and domain-specific language  

### [02-backend]()

- **Services**: Responsibilities and boundaries of each backend service  
- **Data Modeling**: ERDs, schema definitions, normalization/denormalization decisions  
- **Workflows**: Async processing, message queues, background jobs  
- **Scaling & Reliability**: Partitioning, caching strategies, observability  

### [03-frontend]()

- **Design System**: Typography, color tokens, component library  
- **UX Principles**: Accessibility rules, usability heuristics, design philosophy  
- **Wireframes**: User journey mockups (low- and hi-fidelity)  
- **Interaction Flows**: Navigation diagrams, state flows, error-handling patterns  

### [04-devops]()

- **Environments**: Local, staging, production setup  
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Build, test, and deploy flows  
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Observability stack, alerting practices  

### [05-guides]()

- **Contribution Guide**: How to propose design or architecture changes  
- **Decision Records (ADRs)**: Log of major technical and design decisions  
- **Style Guide**: Documentation formatting, diagramming conventions  

### [06-assets]()

- **Diagrams**: System diagrams, ERDs, flowcharts (both source + exported images)  
- **Mockups**: Design files (Figma, Sketch, etc.) and exported images  

## How to use this repository

- Start with the [vision](01-overview/vision.md)
- Architecture decision records (ADRs) are tracked [here]()
- Find diagrams and mockups in the [assets]() section

## Notes

- Keep diagrams **up to date** with the documentation.  
- ADRs should be **short and focused** â€” one decision per record.  
- Documentation should be **developer- and designer-friendly**: clear, concise, and actionable.
